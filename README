Bonsai Kitten - A more flexible way to shape your markup trees

I have begun to think of a view as a function, whose return value is a string-serialized tree.

Views that aggregate other views (as in render :partial => 'blah'), perform the action of grafting the tree of the dependent view into the tree of the calling view at what you might call a 'graft' point. This can be thought of as function composition. Bonsai allows you to use expressions like 

  viewa(viewb)
  
But more importantly, it allows you to also do 

  viewb(viewa)
  
because it separates the linking of views from the content of the views. 
(You wont see "render viewa" inside of viewb, or vice versa).

By coding your views as independent objects to be aggregated, they are more
likely to remain 'closed' (see the Open-Closed principle).

A simple example of grafting (without variables)

bold.bsai:
-------------
<b>{{}}</b>

italic.bsai:
-------------
<i>{{}}</i>

Examples:
---------
>> bsai 'bold(italic)'
=> <b><i></i></b>

>> bsai 'bold(italic)', 'xOx'
=> <b><i>xOx</i></b>

OPEN QUESTIONS: How could/should bonsai deal with multiple graft points ? Allow naming ? What are the illegal use cases in that case ? 

Grafting with Variables

If you dont expect a view to wrap other views, but you want to simply 'dress-up' a data object, you can use variables instead of graft-points. To populate the variables, pass a hash with keys equal to the variable names.

Examples:

name.bsai:
-------------
<div class='name'>{{first}} {{last}}</div>

---------
>> bsai 'name', {:first => 'Dave', :last => 'Matthews'}
=> <div class='name'>Matthews, Dave</div>

Grafting with Variables, Part Deux

When you create a bonsai expression, any participating view can reference any variable. This means there is a flat namespace for lookup. However, the namespace for specifying data is not flat: specifying a key called 'name_fields.first' will target the 'first' field only in the 'name_fields' view. Use this to specify when a name means different things to different views, but omit it for the common case.

name_fields.bsai:
-------------
{{}}
<form id='name'>
  <input name='title' value='{{title}}'/>
  <input name='first' value='{{first}}'/>
  <input name='last' value='{{last}}'/>
</form>

Examples:
---------
>> bsai 'name_fields(name)', {:first => 'Dave', :last => 'Matthews', :title => 'Sir'}
=> 
<div class='name'>Matthews, Dave</div>
<form id='name'>
  <input name='title' value='Sir' />
  <input name='first' value='Dave' />
  <input name='last' value='Matthews' />
</form>


Composition vs. Concatenation

You've seen view1(view2). You might wonder, why not support a concatenation operator ? The above example would then be:

>> bsai 'name+name_fields', :first => 'Dave', :last => 'Matthews', :title => 'Sir'

So far, bonsai intentionally does not support that, because concatenation of
trees does not yield a tree. Mathematically, the set of trees is not closed
under concatenation, like it is closed under non-root-level grafting. If
bonsai were to support concatenation, it might limit implementation options,
or allow you to break your markup. 

QUESTION: Would it be rubier to allow it anyway ?
